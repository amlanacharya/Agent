## ðŸ“š Introduction to Memory Systems with LLM Integration

![Brain Memory](https://media.giphy.com/media/3o7TKsQ8Xb3gcGEgZW/giphy.gif)

Memory is a fundamental component of intelligent agents. Without memory, agents would be stateless, responding to each input in isolation without any context or history. In this lesson, we'll explore how to implement different types of memory systems for AI agents, enhanced with real LLM integration using the Groq API.

> ðŸ’¡ **Note on LLM Integration**: Unlike the standard Module 2 which uses simulated responses, this version integrates with actual Large Language Models through the Groq API. This allows us to leverage the power of LLMs for tasks like summarization, information extraction, and context integration.

### Why Memory Matters in AI Agents

Memory enables agents to:
- Maintain context across multiple interactions
- Learn from past experiences
- Store and retrieve knowledge
- Recognize patterns over time
- Build personalized experiences

### The Human Memory Model

Our approach is inspired by human memory systems:

1. **Working Memory**: Holds immediate context and current task information
2. **Short-Term Memory**: Stores recent interactions and temporary context
3. **Long-Term Memory**: Maintains persistent knowledge and learned information
4. **Episodic Memory**: Records specific experiences and interactions

Let's explore how to implement each of these memory types with LLM enhancement.

## ðŸ”„ Working Memory with LLM Integration

![Working Memory](https://media.giphy.com/media/xT0xeJpnrWC4XWblEk/giphy.gif)

Working memory is the "mental workspace" where an agent holds information relevant to the current task or conversation turn. It has limited capacity but provides quick access to immediately relevant information.

### Implementation with LLM Enhancement

In our implementation, working memory is enhanced with LLM capabilities for better context understanding:

```python
class WorkingMemory:
    def __init__(self, capacity=5):
        self.capacity = capacity
        self.items = deque(maxlen=capacity)
        self.groq_client = GroqClient()
    
    def add(self, item):
        self.items.append({
            'content': item,
            'timestamp': time.time()
        })
    
    def summarize(self):
        """Generate a summary of the current working memory using LLM"""
        if not self.items:
            return "Working memory is empty."
        
        # Format the items for the LLM
        items_text = "\n".join([
            f"{i+1}. {item['content']}" 
            for i, item in enumerate(self.items)
        ])
        
        prompt = f"""
        Summarize the following items currently in working memory:
        
        {items_text}
        
        Provide a concise summary that captures the key information.
        """
        
        response = self.groq_client.generate_text(prompt, max_tokens=150)
        return self.groq_client.extract_text_from_response(response)
```

The key enhancement here is the `summarize()` method, which uses the Groq LLM to generate a concise summary of the current working memory contents. This is particularly useful when the agent needs to maintain awareness of the current context while processing new information.

---

## ðŸ“š Short-Term Memory with LLM Enhancement

![Short-Term Memory](https://media.giphy.com/media/l0HlQXlQ3nHyLMvte/giphy.gif)

Short-term memory stores recent interactions and provides context for the current conversation. It has a larger capacity than working memory but still focuses on recent information.

### Implementation with LLM Enhancement

Our short-term memory implementation is enhanced with LLM capabilities for better conversation understanding:

```python
class ShortTermMemory:
    def __init__(self, capacity=20):
        self.capacity = capacity
        self.items = deque(maxlen=capacity)
        self.groq_client = GroqClient()
    
    def extract_key_information(self, query):
        """Extract key information from short-term memory relevant to a query using LLM"""
        if not self.items:
            return "No information available in short-term memory."
        
        # Format the items for the LLM
        items_text = "\n".join([
            f"{i+1}. {item['content']}" 
            for i, item in enumerate(self.items)
        ])
        
        prompt = f"""
        Given the following recent conversation history in short-term memory:
        
        {items_text}
        
        Extract key information that is relevant to this query: "{query}"
        
        Provide only the most relevant details that would help answer the query.
        """
        
        response = self.groq_client.generate_text(prompt, max_tokens=200)
        return self.groq_client.extract_text_from_response(response)
```

The `extract_key_information()` method uses the Groq LLM to analyze the conversation history and extract information relevant to a specific query. This is much more powerful than simple keyword matching, as the LLM can understand context, infer relationships, and identify implicit information.

## ðŸ’¾ Long-Term Memory with LLM-Powered Retrieval

![Long-Term Memory](https://media.giphy.com/media/3o7TKsQ8Xb3gcGEgZW/giphy.gif)

Long-term memory stores persistent knowledge and learned information. It has virtually unlimited capacity and is used for storing facts, concepts, and other information that needs to be retained over time.

### Implementation with LLM-Powered Retrieval

Our long-term memory implementation uses LLM capabilities for better knowledge organization and retrieval:

```python
class LongTermMemory:
    def __init__(self, storage_path="long_term_memory.json"):
        self.storage_path = storage_path
        self.memory = self._load_memory()
        self.groq_client = GroqClient()
    
    def search(self, query):
        """Search long-term memory for relevant information using LLM"""
        # Format the memory for the LLM
        facts_text = "\n".join([
            f"Fact {i+1}: {fact['content']}" 
            for i, fact in enumerate(self.memory['facts'])
        ])
        
        concepts_text = "\n".join([
            f"Concept: {name}\nInfo: {concept['info']}" 
            for name, concept in self.memory['concepts'].items()
        ])
        
        memory_text = f"""
        FACTS:
        {facts_text}
        
        CONCEPTS:
        {concepts_text}
        """
        
        prompt = f"""
        Given the following information in long-term memory:
        
        {memory_text}
        
        Find and extract information relevant to this query: "{query}"
        
        Return only the most relevant facts and concepts that directly address the query.
        If nothing is relevant, state that no relevant information was found.
        """
        
        response = self.groq_client.generate_text(prompt, max_tokens=300)
        result = self.groq_client.extract_text_from_response(response)
        
        # Return in a structured format
        return [{
            'content': result,
            'source': 'long_term_memory',
            'query': query
        }]
```

The `search()` method uses the Groq LLM to find and extract information from long-term memory that is relevant to a specific query. This approach is much more sophisticated than traditional keyword-based search, as the LLM can understand semantic relationships, handle synonyms, and infer connections between concepts.

## ðŸ§  Episodic Memory with LLM Understanding

![Episodic Memory](https://media.giphy.com/media/3o7TKsQ8Xb3gcGEgZW/giphy.gif)

Episodic memory stores specific experiences and interactions. It helps the agent remember and learn from past episodes, enabling it to recognize patterns and improve over time.

### Implementation with LLM Understanding

Our episodic memory implementation uses LLM capabilities for better episode understanding and retrieval:

```python
class EpisodicMemory:
    def __init__(self):
        self.episodes = []
        self.groq_client = GroqClient()
    
    def search_episodes(self, query):
        """Search episodic memory for relevant episodes using LLM"""
        if not self.episodes:
            return []
        
        # Format the episodes for the LLM
        episodes_text = "\n\n".join([
            f"Episode {i+1}:\n" + 
            "\n".join([f"{k}: {v}" for k, v in episode.items() if k != 'timestamp'])
            for i, episode in enumerate(self.episodes)
        ])
        
        prompt = f"""
        Given the following episodes in episodic memory:
        
        {episodes_text}
        
        Find and extract episodes relevant to this query: "{query}"
        
        Return only the most relevant episodes that directly address the query.
        If nothing is relevant, state that no relevant episodes were found.
        """
        
        response = self.groq_client.generate_text(prompt, max_tokens=300)
        result = self.groq_client.extract_text_from_response(response)
        
        # Parse the LLM response to identify which episodes were mentioned
        relevant_episodes = []
        for i, episode in enumerate(self.episodes):
            episode_marker = f"Episode {i+1}"
            if episode_marker in result:
                relevant_episodes.append(episode)
        
        return relevant_episodes
```

The `search_episodes()` method uses the Groq LLM to find episodes that are relevant to a specific query. This allows the agent to recall past experiences that might be helpful in the current context, even if they don't share exact keywords.

## ðŸ§© Integrated Memory System with LLM

![Integrated Memory](https://media.giphy.com/media/3o7TKsQ8Xb3gcGEgZW/giphy.gif)

An effective agent needs to integrate all these memory types into a cohesive system. Our `AgentMemorySystem` class combines working memory, short-term memory, long-term memory, and episodic memory, with LLM enhancement for better integration.

### Key Features of the Integrated Memory System

1. **Context-Aware Processing**: Uses LLM to extract potential facts from user input
2. **Multi-Memory Retrieval**: Retrieves relevant information from all memory types
3. **Context Integration**: Uses LLM to integrate and prioritize context from different memory systems
4. **Episode Creation**: Creates and stores meaningful episodes for future reference

### LLM-Enhanced Context Integration

The most powerful feature of our integrated memory system is the LLM-enhanced context integration:

```python
def _integrate_context(self, query, context):
    """Use LLM to integrate and prioritize context from different memory systems"""
    # Format the context for the LLM
    context_text = ""
    
    if context.get('working_memory'):
        working_memory_text = "\n".join([
            f"- {item['content']}" for item in context['working_memory']
        ])
        context_text += f"WORKING MEMORY:\n{working_memory_text}\n\n"
    
    # [Similar formatting for other memory types]
    
    prompt = f"""
    Given this query: "{query}"
    
    And the following context from different memory systems:
    
    {context_text}
    
    Integrate and prioritize the most relevant information to answer the query.
    Focus on the most important and directly relevant details.
    Organize the information in a coherent way that would be most helpful for responding to the query.
    """
    
    response = self.groq_client.generate_text(prompt, max_tokens=500)
    integrated_context = self.groq_client.extract_text_from_response(response)
    
    return {
        'raw_context': context,
        'integrated_context': integrated_context,
        'query': query
    }
```

This method uses the Groq LLM to analyze context from all memory systems, identify the most relevant information, and organize it in a coherent way that directly addresses the query. This is far more sophisticated than rule-based approaches, as the LLM can understand complex relationships, prioritize information based on relevance, and present it in a structured format.
