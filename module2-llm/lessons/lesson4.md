## üìö Introduction to Knowledge Base Assistants with LLM Integration

A knowledge base assistant is an AI system that can store, retrieve, and reason with structured knowledge to answer questions and provide information. In this lesson, we'll build a complete knowledge base assistant with real LLM integration using the Groq API.

> üí° **Note on LLM Integration**: Unlike the standard Module 2 which uses simulated responses, this version uses real LLMs through the Groq API for all aspects of the knowledge base assistant, including answer generation, learning, explanation, and uncertainty handling.

### The Architecture of Our Knowledge Base Assistant

Our knowledge base assistant consists of several key components:

1. **Knowledge Base**: Stores and retrieves information using vector embeddings
2. **Conversation Memory**: Maintains context across multiple interactions
3. **Citation Manager**: Adds citations to responses for credibility
4. **Uncertainty Handler**: Manages uncertainty in responses
5. **Learning System**: Extracts new knowledge from interactions

All of these components are enhanced with LLM integration for more sophisticated behavior.

## üèóÔ∏è Building the Knowledge Base Assistant

![Building](https://media.giphy.com/media/3o7TKsQ8Xb3gcGEgZW/giphy.gif)

Let's look at the core implementation of our knowledge base assistant:

```python
class KnowledgeBaseAssistant:
    """
    A knowledge base assistant that can answer questions, learn from conversations,
    and provide citations for its answers, powered by the Groq API.
    """

    def __init__(self, storage_dir="kb_assistant", knowledge_base=None):
        """Initialize the knowledge base assistant"""
        self.storage_dir = storage_dir
        os.makedirs(storage_dir, exist_ok=True)

        # Initialize or load the knowledge base
        self.knowledge_base = knowledge_base or KnowledgeBase(os.path.join(storage_dir, "knowledge_base"))

        # Initialize conversation memory
        self.conversation_memory = ShortTermMemory(capacity=20)

        # Initialize citation manager
        self.citation_manager = CitationManager(self.knowledge_base)

        # Initialize uncertainty handler
        self.uncertainty_handler = UncertaintyHandler(confidence_threshold=0.7)

        # Initialize Groq client
        self.groq_client = GroqClient()

        # Load or initialize settings
        self.settings_path = os.path.join(storage_dir, "settings.json")
        if os.path.exists(self.settings_path):
            with open(self.settings_path, 'r') as f:
                self.settings = json.load(f)
        else:
            self.settings = {
                "citation_style": "standard",
                "confidence_threshold": 0.7,
                "learning_mode": "passive",  # passive, active, or off
                "max_results": 5,
                "system_prompt": "You are a helpful knowledge base assistant that provides accurate information based on your knowledge base."
            }
            self._save_settings()
```

This class integrates all the components we've built in previous lessons:
- The `KnowledgeBase` for storing and retrieving information
- `ShortTermMemory` for maintaining conversation context
- `CitationManager` for adding citations to responses
- `UncertaintyHandler` for managing uncertainty
- `GroqClient` for LLM integration

### Handling User Input

The main entry point for user interaction is the `handle_input` method:

```python
def handle_input(self, user_input):
    """Handle user input and generate an appropriate response"""
    # Simple heuristic to determine if input is a question or statement
    if user_input.strip().endswith("?") or user_input.lower().startswith(("what", "who", "where", "when", "why", "how", "can", "could", "is", "are", "do", "does")):
        return self.answer_question(user_input)
    else:
        # If in active learning mode, learn from all statements
        if self.settings["learning_mode"] == "active":
            return self.learn_from_statement(user_input)
        # If in passive learning mode, only learn from statements that look like facts
        elif self.settings["learning_mode"] == "passive":
            # Simple heuristic for fact-like statements
            if any(phrase in user_input.lower() for phrase in ["is a", "are a", "refers to", "defined as", "means", "consists of"]):
                return self.learn_from_statement(user_input)
            else:
                # Process as a regular input
                return self.generate_response(user_input)
        else:
            # Learning mode is off, just generate a response
            return self.generate_response(user_input)
```

This method:
1. Determines if the input is a question or statement
2. Routes questions to the `answer_question` method
3. Routes statements to either `learn_from_statement` or `generate_response` based on the learning mode

## üß† Implementing Learning Capabilities with LLM

![Learning](https://media.giphy.com/media/3o7TKsQ8Xb3gcGEgZW/giphy.gif)

One of the most powerful features of our knowledge base assistant is its ability to learn from interactions. Let's look at how we implement this with LLM integration:

```python
def _learn_from_interaction(self, question, answer, results):
    """Learn from the interaction by extracting new knowledge"""
    # Get recent conversation context
    recent_turns = self.conversation_memory.get_recent(5)
    conversation_text = "\n".join([
        f"{turn['content']['role']}: {turn['content']['content']}"
        for turn in recent_turns
    ])

    prompt = f"""
    Analyze this conversation and identify new facts that should be added to the knowledge base:

    Conversation:
    {conversation_text}

    Current question: "{question}"
    Current answer: "{answer}"

    Extract 0-3 new facts that:
    1. Are not already in the retrieved results
    2. Are factual and objective (not opinions)
    3. Would be useful for future questions

    For each fact, provide:
    - fact: The factual statement
    - confidence: How confident you are that this is factual (high, medium, low)
    - source: Where this fact comes from (user, inference, or external)

    Return a JSON array of facts. If no new facts should be added, return an empty array.
    """

    response = self.groq_client.generate_text(prompt, max_tokens=500)
    result = self.groq_client.extract_text_from_response(response)

    # Parse the JSON response
    facts = json.loads(result)
    if isinstance(facts, list):
        # Add high-confidence facts to the knowledge base
        for fact_item in facts:
            if isinstance(fact_item, dict) and 'fact' in fact_item:
                fact = fact_item['fact']
                confidence = fact_item.get('confidence', 'low')
                source = fact_item.get('source', 'conversation')

                if confidence.lower() in ['high', 'medium']:
                    self.knowledge_base.add_item(fact, {
                        'source': source,
                        'confidence': confidence,
                        'extracted_from': 'conversation',
                        'timestamp': datetime.now().isoformat()
                    })
```

This method uses the LLM to analyze the conversation and extract new facts that should be added to the knowledge base. It's a form of continuous learning that allows the assistant to improve over time.

### Learning Modes

Our assistant supports three learning modes:

1. **Active**: Learn from all statements and interactions
2. **Passive**: Only learn from statements that look like facts
3. **Off**: Don't learn from interactions

This allows users to control how aggressively the assistant learns from interactions.

## üîç Creating Explainable AI Features with LLM

![Explainable AI](https://media.giphy.com/media/3o7TKsQ8Xb3gcGEgZW/giphy.gif)

Explainable AI is crucial for building trust and understanding how the system works. Our knowledge base assistant includes several explainable AI features:

```python
def explain_answer(self, question):
    """Explain how the assistant arrived at an answer"""
    # Retrieve relevant knowledge
    retrieval_results = self.knowledge_base.retrieve_with_explanation(
        question, top_k=self.settings["max_results"]
    )

    # Assess confidence
    confidence = self.uncertainty_handler.assess_confidence(
        question, retrieval_results['results']
    )

    # Generate answer with uncertainty handling
    answer = self.uncertainty_handler.generate_response_with_uncertainty(
        question, retrieval_results['results'], confidence
    )

    # Generate explanation of the reasoning process
    reasoning_explanation = self._explain_reasoning_process(
        question, retrieval_results['results'], answer, confidence
    )

    return {
        'question': question,
        'answer': answer,
        'confidence': confidence,
        'retrieval_explanation': retrieval_results['explanation'],
        'reasoning_explanation': reasoning_explanation,
        'results': retrieval_results['results']
    }
```

This method provides a comprehensive explanation of how the assistant arrived at an answer, including:
- How relevant information was retrieved
- The confidence level in the answer
- The reasoning process used to generate the answer
- The actual results that were used

### Explaining the Reasoning Process with LLM

The key to explainable AI is the ability to explain the reasoning process:

```python
def _explain_reasoning_process(self, question, results, answer, confidence):
    """Explain the reasoning process used to generate an answer"""
    # Format results for the LLM
    results_text = "\n\n".join([
        f"Result {i+1} (Similarity: {result['similarity']:.4f}):\n{result['text']}"
        for i, result in enumerate(results)
    ])

    prompt = f"""
    Explain the reasoning process used to generate this answer:

    Question: "{question}"

    Retrieved information:
    {results_text}

    Confidence: {confidence:.2f}

    Answer: "{answer}"

    Provide a step-by-step explanation of:
    1. How the relevant information was identified
    2. How the information was synthesized
    3. How confidence was assessed
    4. Any limitations or uncertainties in the answer

    Explanation:
    """

    response = self.groq_client.generate_text(prompt, max_tokens=500)
    return self.groq_client.extract_text_from_response(response)
```

This method uses the LLM to generate a step-by-step explanation of the reasoning process, making the system's decision-making transparent to users.

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Developing Uncertainty Handling with LLM

![Uncertainty](https://media.giphy.com/media/3o7TKsQ8Xb3gcGEgZW/giphy.gif)

Responsible AI systems should acknowledge uncertainty when appropriate. Our knowledge base assistant includes sophisticated uncertainty handling:

```python
class UncertaintyHandler:
    """Handler for managing uncertainty in knowledge base responses."""

    def __init__(self, confidence_threshold=0.7):
        """Initialize the uncertainty handler"""
        self.confidence_threshold = confidence_threshold
        self.groq_client = GroqClient()

    def assess_confidence(self, query, results):
        """Assess confidence in the results for a query"""
        if not results:
            return 0.0

        # Calculate confidence based on similarity scores
        similarities = [result['similarity'] for result in results]
        avg_similarity = sum(similarities) / len(similarities)
        max_similarity = max(similarities)

        # Weight max similarity more heavily
        confidence = 0.7 * max_similarity + 0.3 * avg_similarity

        return min(1.0, max(0.0, confidence))

    def generate_response_with_uncertainty(self, query, results, confidence):
        """Generate a response that acknowledges uncertainty when appropriate"""
        # Format results for the LLM
        results_text = "\n\n".join([
            f"Result {i+1} (Similarity: {result['similarity']:.4f}):\n{result['text']}"
            for i, result in enumerate(results)
        ])

        # Determine confidence level
        if confidence >= self.confidence_threshold:
            confidence_level = "high"
        elif confidence >= self.confidence_threshold / 2:
            confidence_level = "medium"
        else:
            confidence_level = "low"

        prompt = f"""
        Generate a response to this query: "{query}"

        Based on these retrieved results:
        {results_text}

        Confidence level: {confidence_level} (score: {confidence:.2f})

        Guidelines:
        - If confidence is high, provide a direct and authoritative response
        - If confidence is medium, provide a response but acknowledge some uncertainty
        - If confidence is low, acknowledge significant uncertainty and provide caveats
        - If the results don't answer the query well, acknowledge the limitations
        - Synthesize information from multiple results when appropriate

        Response:
        """

        response = self.groq_client.generate_text(prompt, max_tokens=500)
        return self.groq_client.extract_text_from_response(response)
```

This class:
1. Assesses confidence based on similarity scores
2. Determines the appropriate confidence level (high, medium, low)
3. Uses the LLM to generate a response that acknowledges uncertainty when appropriate

This ensures that the assistant is honest about its limitations and doesn't provide misleading information.

---

## üìù Adding Citation Management with LLM

![Citations](https://media.giphy.com/media/3o7TKsQ8Xb3gcGEgZW/giphy.gif)

Credible AI systems should provide citations for their information. Our knowledge base assistant includes a citation manager:

```python
class CitationManager:
    """Manager for adding citations to responses."""

    def __init__(self, knowledge_base):
        """Initialize the citation manager"""
        self.knowledge_base = knowledge_base
        self.groq_client = GroqClient()

    def add_citations_to_response(self, response, sources, citation_style="standard"):
        """Add citations to a response"""
        if not sources:
            return response

        # Format sources for the LLM
        sources_text = "\n\n".join([
            f"Source {i+1}:\nText: {source['text']}\nMetadata: {json.dumps(source.get('metadata', {}))}"
            for i, source in enumerate(sources)
        ])

        prompt = f"""
        Add citations to this response according to the {citation_style} citation style:

        Response:
        {response}

        Sources:
        {sources_text}

        Return the response with appropriate citations added. The citations should reference the specific sources used.
        If a part of the response doesn't come from any source, don't add a citation for that part.
        """

        response = self.groq_client.generate_text(prompt, max_tokens=1000)
        return self.groq_client.extract_text_from_response(response)
```

This class uses the LLM to add appropriate citations to responses, making it clear where the information comes from and increasing the credibility of the assistant.

### Generating Bibliographies

The citation manager can also generate bibliographies:

```python
def generate_bibliography(self, sources, style="standard"):
    """Generate a bibliography for a set of sources"""
    if not sources:
        return "No sources to cite."

    # Format sources for the LLM
    sources_text = "\n\n".join([
        f"Source {i+1}:\nText: {source['text']}\nMetadata: {json.dumps(source.get('metadata', {}))}"
        for i, source in enumerate(sources)
    ])

    prompt = f"""
    Generate a bibliography in {style} style for these sources:

    {sources_text}

    Return only the formatted bibliography entries, one per line.
    """

    response = self.groq_client.generate_text(prompt, max_tokens=500)
    return self.groq_client.extract_text_from_response(response)
```

This method generates a properly formatted bibliography for a set of sources, which can be useful for academic or professional contexts.

## üß™ Putting It All Together: The Complete Knowledge Base Assistant

![Complete Assistant](https://media.giphy.com/media/3o7TKsQ8Xb3gcGEgZW/giphy.gif)

Now that we've explored all the components, let's see how they work together in the `answer_question` method:

```python
def answer_question(self, question):
    """Answer a question using the knowledge base"""
    # Process the question
    processed_input = self.process_input(question)

    # Retrieve relevant knowledge
    results = self.knowledge_base.retrieve(question, top_k=self.settings["max_results"])

    # Assess confidence
    confidence = self.uncertainty_handler.assess_confidence(question, results)

    # Generate answer with uncertainty handling
    answer = self.uncertainty_handler.generate_response_with_uncertainty(
        question, results, confidence
    )

    # Add citations
    if results:
        answer = self.citation_manager.add_citations_to_response(
            answer, results, self.settings["citation_style"]
        )

    # Store the answer in conversation memory
    self.conversation_memory.add({
        'role': 'assistant',
        'content': answer,
        'timestamp': datetime.now().isoformat()
    })

    # Learn from the interaction if learning mode is active
    if self.settings["learning_mode"] == "active":
        self._learn_from_interaction(question, answer, results)

    return answer
```

This method:
1. Processes the question and extracts key information
2. Retrieves relevant knowledge from the knowledge base
3. Assesses confidence in the results
4. Generates an answer that acknowledges uncertainty when appropriate
5. Adds citations to the answer
6. Stores the answer in conversation memory for future context
7. Learns from the interaction if learning mode is active

The result is a sophisticated knowledge base assistant that can answer questions, learn from interactions, acknowledge uncertainty, and provide citations for its information.
