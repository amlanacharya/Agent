## 🎯 Study Strategies

### Implementation Approach
1. **Start with minimal prototypes**: Build the simplest version first, then expand
2. **Use test-driven development**: Create test cases before implementing features
3. **Keep a coding journal**: Document challenges and solutions for reference
4. **Build a personal library**: Create reusable components as you learn
5. **Practice spaced repetition**: Revisit core concepts regularly

### Learning Optimization
1. **Daily practice**: Aim for consistent daily implementation (30-60 minutes minimum)
2. **Teach as you learn**: Document and explain concepts to solidify understanding
3. **Join study groups**: Collaborate with others learning similar topics
4. **Use AI pair programming**: Work with AI assistants to accelerate development
5. **Build in public**: Share progress on GitHub or social media for feedback
