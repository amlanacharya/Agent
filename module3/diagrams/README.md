### Progressive Journey Diagrams

9. **[Module 3 Progressive Journey](module3_progressive_journey.md)** - A stage-by-stage breakdown of how data flows through Module 3, gradually building up to the complete picture:

   - **Data Flow Diagram**: 6 progressive stages from basic data sources to the complete system
   - **Sequence Diagram**: 5 progressive stages showing the interaction between components
   - **Class Diagram**: 4 progressive stages revealing the structure and relationships

## How to View These Diagrams

These diagrams use Mermaid syntax, which can be rendered in:

1. GitHub Markdown files (automatically rendered)
2. VS Code with the Mermaid extension
3. Online Mermaid editors like [Mermaid Live Editor](https://mermaid.live/)
4. Documentation tools like MkDocs with the Mermaid plugin

## Diagram Types

The diagrams in this directory include:

- **Class Diagrams** - Showing the structure and relationships between classes
- **Sequence Diagrams** - Illustrating the flow of operations between components
- **Flowcharts** - Depicting processes and decision flows
- **Entity Relationship Diagrams** - Showing data models and their relationships

## Progressive Approach

Many of the diagrams in this collection follow a progressive approach:

1. **Stage-by-Stage Breakdown** - Complex systems are broken down into simpler stages
2. **Incremental Complexity** - Each stage builds on the previous one, gradually adding complexity
3. **Focused Understanding** - Allows readers to understand each component before seeing the complete picture

This approach has several benefits:
- Makes complex systems more digestible
- Creates a narrative that guides the reader through the architecture
- Helps identify relationships between components more clearly
- Provides both high-level overviews and detailed implementations
