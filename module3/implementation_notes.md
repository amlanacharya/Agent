## LLM Integration Notes

- Module 3 integrates with real LLMs through the Groq API
- The implementation includes fallback to simulated responses when the API is unavailable
- The architecture is designed to be flexible, allowing for different LLM providers
- The output parsing system is designed to handle the variability of LLM responses
- Error handling is implemented to gracefully handle API failures

## Next Steps
