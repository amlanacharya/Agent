# Module 4 Diagrams

This directory contains diagrams illustrating various aspects of Module 4: Document Processing & RAG Foundations.

## Available Diagrams

### Complete Diagrams

1. **[Module 4 Diagrams](../lessons/module4_diagrams.md)** - Original diagrams from the module lessons showing document processing pipelines, chunking strategies, embedding generation, metadata extraction, and RAG systems.

### Progressive Journey Diagrams

2. **[Module 4 Progressive Journey](module4_progressive_journey.md)** - A stage-by-stage breakdown of the document processing and RAG systems in Module 4, gradually building up to the complete picture:

   - **Document Processing Pipeline**: 4 progressive stages from raw document loading to structured document representation
   - **Chunking Strategies**: 5 progressive stages showing the evolution of text splitting approaches
   - **Embedding Generation**: 3 progressive stages demonstrating the embedding pipeline development
   - **RAG System Architecture**: 5 progressive stages revealing increasingly sophisticated RAG implementations

## How to View These Diagrams

These diagrams use Mermaid syntax, which can be rendered in:

1. GitHub Markdown files (automatically rendered)
2. VS Code with the Mermaid extension
3. Online Mermaid editors like [Mermaid Live Editor](https://mermaid.live/)
4. Documentation tools like MkDocs with the Mermaid plugin

## Diagram Types

The diagrams in this directory include:

- **Flowcharts** - Depicting document processing pipelines and data flows
- **Class Diagrams** - Showing the structure and relationships between system components
- **Sequence Diagrams** - Illustrating the flow of operations in RAG systems
- **Architecture Diagrams** - Representing the overall system design

## Progressive Approach

Many of the diagrams in this collection follow a progressive approach:

1. **Stage-by-Stage Breakdown** - Complex systems are broken down into simpler stages
2. **Incremental Complexity** - Each stage builds on the previous one, gradually adding complexity
3. **Focused Understanding** - Allows readers to understand each component before seeing the complete picture

This approach has several benefits:
- Makes complex systems more digestible
- Creates a narrative that guides the reader through the architecture
- Helps identify relationships between components more clearly
- Provides both high-level overviews and detailed implementations
