# Module 1 Diagrams

This directory contains diagrams illustrating various aspects of Module 1: Agent Fundamentals.

## Available Diagrams

### Complete Diagrams

1. **[Module 1 Diagrams](../lessons/module1_diagrams.md)** - Original diagrams from the module lessons showing agent architecture, prompt engineering flow, and class hierarchy.

### Progressive Journey Diagrams

2. **[Module 1 Progressive Journey](module1_progressive_journey.md)** - A stage-by-stage breakdown of the agent architecture in Module 1, gradually building up to the complete picture:

   - **Agent Architecture**: 5 progressive stages from basic sense-think-act loop to complete TaskManagerAgent
   - **Prompt Engineering Flow**: 3 progressive stages showing how prompts are processed
   - **Class Hierarchy**: 4 progressive stages revealing the inheritance relationships between agent classes

## How to View These Diagrams

These diagrams use Mermaid syntax, which can be rendered in:

1. GitHub Markdown files (automatically rendered)
2. VS Code with the Mermaid extension
3. Online Mermaid editors like [Mermaid Live Editor](https://mermaid.live/)
4. Documentation tools like MkDocs with the Mermaid plugin

## Diagram Types

The diagrams in this directory include:

- **Flowcharts** - Depicting the agent loop and data flows
- **Class Diagrams** - Showing the structure and relationships between classes
- **Sequence Diagrams** - Illustrating the flow of operations between components

## Progressive Approach

Many of the diagrams in this collection follow a progressive approach:

1. **Stage-by-Stage Breakdown** - Complex systems are broken down into simpler stages
2. **Incremental Complexity** - Each stage builds on the previous one, gradually adding complexity
3. **Focused Understanding** - Allows readers to understand each component before seeing the complete picture

This approach has several benefits:
- Makes complex systems more digestible
- Creates a narrative that guides the reader through the architecture
- Helps identify relationships between components more clearly
- Provides both high-level overviews and detailed implementations
