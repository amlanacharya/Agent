## Best Practices Used

- Comprehensive docstrings for all classes and methods
- Type hints and parameter descriptions
- Error handling for edge cases
- Modular design with clear separation of concerns
- Consistent naming conventions
- Progressive enhancement of functionality across implementations

## LLM Integration Notes

- Module 1 uses simulated LLM responses rather than integrating with real LLMs
- This approach allows learning the fundamentals without dealing with API keys, rate limits, or costs
- The architecture is designed to be compatible with real LLM integration in later modules
- Comments in the code indicate where real LLM calls would be made in a production system

## Next Steps

- Integrate with actual LLMs in later modules
- Enhance intent detection with more sophisticated techniques
- Implement more advanced state management patterns
- Add support for more complex task relationships
- Implement natural language understanding for more flexible command parsing
