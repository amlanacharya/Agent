## 📚 Overview

Welcome to Module 1 of the Accelerated Agentic AI Mastery course! This module covers the fundamental concepts of AI agents, focusing on the core agent loop (sense-think-act), prompt engineering basics, and state management patterns.

## 📂 Module Structure

```

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Start by reading through **lessons/lesson1.md** to understand the core concepts
2. Examine the code in **code/simple_agent.py** to see a basic implementation
3. Run the test script to see the agent in action:
   ```
   python module1/code/test_simple_agent.py
   ```
4. Try the interactive demo by running:
   ```
   python module1/code/simple_agent.py
   ```
5. Complete the practice exercises at the end of the lesson
6. Check your solutions against **exercises/exercise_solutions.py** (but try to solve them yourself first!)

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will:
- Understand the core agent loop (sense-think-act)
- Master prompt engineering fundamentals
- Learn basic state management patterns
- Build a simple personal task manager agent

## 🧪 Practice Exercises

The lesson includes several practice exercises to help reinforce your learning:
1. Extending the SimpleAgent with new capabilities
2. Implementing conversation history tracking
3. Enhancing input processing with basic intent recognition

## 📝 Mini-Project: Personal Task Manager

Throughout this module, you'll be building a Personal Task Manager agent that can:
- Accept natural language commands to create, update, and delete tasks
- Store tasks with priority levels and due dates
- Respond to queries about task status
- Provide daily summaries of pending tasks
