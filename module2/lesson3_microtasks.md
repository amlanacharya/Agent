# Lesson 3: Retrieval Patterns for Contextual Memory - Micro-Task Breakdown

This document provides a detailed breakdown of the micro-tasks completed for Lesson 3, explaining the purpose and implementation details of each task.

## Overview

Lesson 3 focuses on retrieval patterns for contextual memory, building on the memory types from Lesson 1 and vector databases from Lesson 2. The implementation was broken down into 10 micro-tasks to make the development process more manageable.

## Micro-Task Details

### Micro-Task 7: Implement the HybridRetrievalSystem class

**Purpose:** Create a system that combines multiple memory types for comprehensive retrieval.

**Implementation Details:**

**Key Features:**
- Checks for exact matches in long-term memory

- Provides explanations for why each result was returned

### Micro-Task 8: Implement the ContextAwareRetrieval class

**Purpose:** Create a system that considers the broader context of the interaction.

**Implementation Details:**
- Created `ContextAwareRetrieval` class that takes a memory system and conversation memory
- Implemented `retrieve` method that enhances queries with context

- Added `retrieve_with_context_explanation` method for transparency

**Key Features:**
- Extracts keywords from conversation history
- Considers user profile information (interests, expertise level)
- Provides detailed explanations of how context influenced retrieval
- Adds context information to each result

### Micro-Task 9: Implement the RelevanceScorer class

**Purpose:** Create a system for scoring items based on multiple factors.

## Code Organization

The implementation for Lesson 3 is organized into two main files:

1. **retrieval_agent.py**: Contains all the retrieval patterns and classes
   - Basic retrieval functions at the top
   - Advanced retrieval classes below
   - Clear separation between different components

2. **test_retrieval_agent.py** and **test_advanced_retrieval.py**: Test scripts
   - Separate tests for basic and advanced functionality
   - Helper functions for setting up test data
   - Detailed output to demonstrate functionality

## Key Concepts Implemented

1. **Contextual Retrieval**: Enhancing queries with conversation context
2. **Multi-Query Retrieval**: Using multiple query variations for better recall
3. **Hybrid Retrieval**: Combining multiple memory types
4. **Context-Aware Retrieval**: Considering user profile and conversation history
5. **Relevance Scoring**: Combining multiple factors for better ranking

## Usage Examples

### Basic Retrieval Patterns

```python
# Recency-based retrieval
results = recency_based_retrieval("AI", memory_system, max_age_hours=24, top_k=5)

# Conversation-aware retrieval
results = conversation_aware_retrieval("AI", conversation_history, memory_system, top_k=5)

# Multi-query retrieval
results = multi_query_retrieval("AI", memory_system, top_k=5)
```

### Advanced Retrieval Systems

```python
# Conversation Memory
memory = ConversationMemory(vector_store)
memory.add_turn("Hello", "Hi there!")
recent_turns = memory.get_recent_turns(3)
relevant_turns = memory.search_conversation("greeting", top_k=2)

# Hybrid Retrieval System
hybrid = HybridRetrievalSystem(vector_memory, episodic_memory, long_term_memory)
results = hybrid.retrieve("AI", conversation_context, top_k=5)
results_with_explanation = hybrid.retrieve_with_explanation("AI", conversation_context)

# Context-Aware Retrieval
context_retrieval = ContextAwareRetrieval(memory_system, conversation_memory)
results = context_retrieval.retrieve("AI", user_profile, top_k=5)
results_with_explanation = context_retrieval.retrieve_with_context_explanation("AI", user_profile)

# Relevance Scorer
scorer = RelevanceScorer(weights={'base_similarity': 0.4, 'recency': 0.3, 'user_interest_match': 0.2, 'conversation_relevance': 0.1})
score = scorer.score_item(item, query, user_profile, conversation_context)
ranked_results = scorer.score_and_rank_results(results, query, user_profile, conversation_context)
```

## Next Steps

The implementation of Lesson 3 provides a solid foundation for building the Knowledge Base Assistant in Lesson 4. The next steps would be:

1. Implement the Knowledge Base Assistant using the retrieval patterns from Lesson 3
2. Add learning capabilities to acquire new information
3. Implement question answering based on stored knowledge
4. Create a system that can identify when it doesn't know something
5. Add citation tracking for providing sources
