## 📚 Introduction to Knowledge Base Assistants

![Knowledge Management](https://media.giphy.com/media/3o7btPCcdNniyf0ArS/giphy.gif)

A Knowledge Base Assistant is an AI agent that can store, retrieve, and reason with structured knowledge. Unlike simple chatbots, knowledge base assistants can:

1. **Maintain a persistent knowledge store**
2. **Answer questions based on stored knowledge**
3. **Learn new information** from conversations
4. **Identify knowledge gaps** when they don't know something
5. **Provide citations** for their answers

In this lesson, we'll build on the memory systems and retrieval patterns from previous lessons to create a complete knowledge base assistant.

## 🏗️ Architecture of a Knowledge Base Assistant

![Architecture](https://media.giphy.com/media/3o7btNDyBs5dKdhTqM/giphy.gif)

A knowledge base assistant consists of several key components:

### 1. Knowledge Store

The foundation of our assistant is a structured knowledge store:

- **Vector Database**: For semantic retrieval of knowledge
- **Metadata Store**: For tracking sources, timestamps, and confidence
- **Relationship Graph**: For connecting related pieces of knowledge

### 2. Knowledge Retrieval System

The retrieval system finds relevant information based on user queries:

- **Query Processing**: Parsing and understanding user questions
- **Semantic Search**: Finding relevant knowledge using embeddings
- **Ranking**: Prioritizing the most relevant information
- **Answer Formulation**: Constructing coherent responses

### 3. Knowledge Acquisition System

The assistant needs to learn from interactions:

- **Information Extraction**: Identifying new facts from conversations
- **Validation**: Verifying new information before storage
- **Conflict Resolution**: Handling contradictory information
- **Knowledge Integration**: Adding new knowledge to the existing base

### 4. Uncertainty Handling

A good assistant knows when it doesn't know:

- **Confidence Estimation**: Assessing confidence in answers
- **Unknown Detection**: Identifying when information is missing
- **Clarification Requests**: Asking for more information when needed

## 🔍 Implementing the Knowledge Base

![Implementation](https://media.giphy.com/media/3o7btZ1Gm7ZL25pLMs/giphy.gif)

Let's implement the core knowledge base component:

```python
class KnowledgeBase:
    def __init__(self, vector_db_path="knowledge_vectors"):
        """Initialize the knowledge base"""
        # Initialize vector store for semantic search
        self.vector_store = VectorStore(vector_db_path)
        
        # Metadata storage for knowledge entries
        self.metadata = {}
        
        # Knowledge graph for relationships
        self.relationships = {}
    
    def add_knowledge(self, knowledge_text, metadata=None):
        """Add a new piece of knowledge to the base"""
        # Generate a unique ID for this knowledge
        knowledge_id = str(uuid.uuid4())
        
        # Store the text in the vector database for semantic search
        self.vector_store.add_text(knowledge_id, knowledge_text)
        
        # Store metadata (source, timestamp, confidence, etc.)
        self.metadata[knowledge_id] = {
            "text": knowledge_text,
            "timestamp": time.time(),

    def retrieve_knowledge(self, query, top_k=5):
        """Retrieve knowledge relevant to the query"""
        # Find semantically similar knowledge entries

        enhanced_results = []
        for knowledge_id, similarity in results:

                self.metadata[knowledge_id]["last_accessed"] = time.time()

        return enhanced_results
    
    def add_relationship(self, source_id, target_id, relationship_type):
        """Add a relationship between knowledge entries"""
        if source_id not in self.relationships:

    def save(self, file_path="knowledge_base.json"):
        """Save the knowledge base to disk"""

## 📝 Building the Knowledge Base Assistant

![Assistant](https://media.giphy.com/media/3o7TKsQ8Xb3gcGEgZW/giphy.gif)

Now, let's implement the assistant that uses our knowledge base:

```python
class KnowledgeBaseAssistant:
    def __init__(self, knowledge_base=None):
        """Initialize the knowledge base assistant"""
        self.knowledge_base = knowledge_base or KnowledgeBase()
        self.conversation_memory = ShortTermMemory(capacity=20)

        if not knowledge_results:
            # No relevant knowledge found
            response = self._handle_unknown(question)
        else:
            # Check if the top result is confident enough
            top_result = knowledge_results[0]
            if top_result["similarity"] * top_result["confidence"] >= self.confidence_threshold:
                # Generate answer with citation
                response = self._generate_answer(question, knowledge_results)
            else:
                # Not confident enough
                response = self._handle_uncertain(question, knowledge_results)
        
        # Add response to conversation memory
        self.conversation_memory.add({"role": "assistant", "content": response})
        
        return response
    
    def _generate_answer(self, question, knowledge_results):
        """Generate an answer based on retrieved knowledge"""
        # In a real implementation, this would use an LLM to generate a coherent answer
        # For this example, we'll use a simple template
        
        answer = f"Based on my knowledge, I can tell you that {knowledge_results[0]['text']}"
        
        # Add citation
        source = knowledge_results[0]["source"]
        if source != "unknown":
            answer += f" (Source: {source})"
        
        # Add related information if available
        if len(knowledge_results) > 1:
            answer += f"\n\nAdditionally, you might want to know that {knowledge_results[1]['text']}"
        
        return answer
    
    def _handle_unknown(self, question):
        """Handle case where no knowledge is available"""
        return "I don't have information about that in my knowledge base. Would you like to teach me about this topic?"
    
    def _handle_uncertain(self, question, knowledge_results):
        """Handle case where confidence is low"""
        return f"I'm not entirely sure, but I think {knowledge_results[0]['text']}. Please note that my confidence in this answer is low."
    
    def learn_from_statement(self, statement, source="user"):
        """Learn new information from a statement"""
        # Add statement to conversation memory
        self.conversation_memory.add({"role": "user", "content": statement})
        
        # Extract knowledge from the statement
        # In a real implementation, this would use an LLM or information extraction system
        # For this example, we'll just use the statement directly
        
        # Add to knowledge base
        knowledge_id = self.knowledge_base.add_knowledge(statement, {
            "source": source,
            "confidence": 0.8  # Lower confidence for user-provided information
        })
        
        response = "Thank you for sharing that information. I've added it to my knowledge base."
        
        # Add response to conversation memory
        self.conversation_memory.add({"role": "assistant", "content": response})
        
        return response
    
    def save(self, directory="assistant_data"):

            return "Assistant state loaded successfully."
        else:
            return "No saved state found."
```

## 🧩 Citation System

![Citations](https://media.giphy.com/media/3o7btPCcdNniyf0ArS/giphy.gif)

A key feature of knowledge base assistants is the ability to cite sources. Let's enhance our citation system:

```python
class CitationManager:
    def __init__(self, knowledge_base):
        """Initialize the citation manager"""
        self.knowledge_base = knowledge_base
    
    def format_citation(self, knowledge_entry, citation_style="standard"):
        """Format a citation for a knowledge entry"""
        if citation_style == "standard":
            source = knowledge_entry["source"]
            if source == "unknown":
                return "No source available"
            
            timestamp = datetime.fromtimestamp(knowledge_entry["timestamp"])
            date_str = timestamp.strftime("%Y-%m-%d")
            
            return f"{source} ({date_str})"
        
        elif citation_style == "academic":
            source = knowledge_entry["source"]
            if source == "unknown":
                return "Unknown source"
            
            timestamp = datetime.fromtimestamp(knowledge_entry["timestamp"])
            year = timestamp.year
            
            return f"{source}, {year}"
        
        elif citation_style == "url":
            source = knowledge_entry["source"]
            if source.startswith("http"):
                return f"[Source]({source})"
            else:
                return source
        
        return knowledge_entry["source"]
    
    def add_citations_to_response(self, response, knowledge_entries, citation_style="standard"):
        """Add citations to a response"""
        if not knowledge_entries:
            return response
        
        # Add citations section
        response += "\n\nSources:"
        
        for i, entry in enumerate(knowledge_entries):
            citation = self.format_citation(entry, citation_style)
            response += f"\n[{i+1}] {citation}"
        
        return response
```

## 🤔 Uncertainty Handling

![Uncertainty](https://media.giphy.com/media/3o7TKT6gL5B7Lzq3re/giphy.gif)

A sophisticated knowledge base assistant should handle uncertainty gracefully:

```python
class UncertaintyHandler:
    def __init__(self, confidence_threshold=0.7):
        """Initialize the uncertainty handler"""
        self.confidence_threshold = confidence_threshold
    
    def evaluate_confidence(self, knowledge_results):
        """Evaluate confidence in the knowledge results"""
        if not knowledge_results:
            return 0.0
        
        # Calculate overall confidence based on similarity and stored confidence
        top_result = knowledge_results[0]
        return top_result["similarity"] * top_result["confidence"]
    
    def generate_response(self, question, knowledge_results):
        """Generate a response with appropriate uncertainty markers"""
        confidence = self.evaluate_confidence(knowledge_results)
        
        if confidence >= self.confidence_threshold:
            # High confidence response
            prefix = "Based on my knowledge, "
            suffix = ""
        elif confidence >= self.confidence_threshold * 0.7:
            # Medium confidence
            prefix = "I believe that "
            suffix = ", though I'm not entirely certain."
        elif confidence >= self.confidence_threshold * 0.4:
            # Low confidence
            prefix = "I'm not entirely sure, but I think "
            suffix = ". Please verify this information."
        else:
            # Very low confidence
            return "I don't have enough reliable information to answer that question confidently."
        
        if knowledge_results:
            answer = prefix + knowledge_results[0]["text"] + suffix
            return answer
        else:
            return "I don't have information about that in my knowledge base."
    
    def should_ask_clarification(self, question, knowledge_results):
        """Determine if clarification is needed"""
        confidence = self.evaluate_confidence(knowledge_results)
        
        # If confidence is low but not extremely low, ask for clarification
        return 0.3 <= confidence < self.confidence_threshold * 0.7
    
    def generate_clarification_request(self, question, knowledge_results):
        """Generate a request for clarification"""
        if not knowledge_results:
            return "Could you provide more details about what you're asking? I don't have information on this topic."
        
        # Extract key terms from the question
        # In a real implementation, this would use NLP techniques
        # For this example, we'll use a simple approach
        
        return f"I'm not sure I understand your question about '{question}'. Could you rephrase or provide more context?"
```
