## Lesson 3: Retrieval Patterns for Contextual Memory

### Implementation Process - Broken Down into Micro-Tasks

#### Basic Retrieval Patterns

1. **Micro-Task 1: Create the basic structure for retrieval_agent.py**
   - Set up file with proper imports and documentation
   - Prepared the structure for implementing retrieval patterns

2. **Micro-Task 2: Implement the recency-based retrieval function**
   - Created a function that prioritizes recent information
   - Added scoring that combines relevance and recency
   - Implemented filtering based on timestamp

3. **Micro-Task 3: Implement the conversation-aware retrieval function**
   - Created a function that enhances queries with conversation context
   - Added extraction of recent user messages from conversation history
   - Implemented metadata to track how the query was enhanced

4. **Micro-Task 4: Implement the multi-query retrieval function**
   - Created a function that generates multiple query variations
   - Added synonym replacement for better recall
   - Implemented deduplication of results from different queries

5. **Micro-Task 5: Create a test script for the retrieval patterns**
   - Implemented tests for each retrieval pattern
   - Added comparison between enhanced and regular retrieval
   - Created a sample memory system with test data

#### Advanced Retrieval Systems

6. **Micro-Task 6: Implement the ConversationMemory class**
   - Created a system that stores conversation turns
   - Added semantic search capabilities for finding relevant past interactions
   - Implemented methods for retrieving recent turns and generating conversation summaries

7. **Micro-Task 7: Implement the HybridRetrievalSystem class**
   - Created a system that combines multiple memory types (vector, episodic, long-term)
   - Implemented a method to retrieve information from all sources
   - Added explanation capabilities to help understand why results were returned

8. **Micro-Task 8: Implement the ContextAwareRetrieval class**
   - Created a system that considers conversation context and user profiles
   - Implemented methods to extract keywords from conversations
   - Added query enhancement based on context and user information

9. **Micro-Task 9: Implement the RelevanceScorer class**
   - Created a system for scoring items based on multiple factors
   - Implemented methods for calculating recency, user interest, and conversation relevance scores
   - Added a method to score and rank a list of results

10. **Micro-Task 10: Create a test script for the advanced retrieval classes**
    - Implemented tests for each of the advanced retrieval classes
    - Created helper functions to set up test data
    - Added detailed output to demonstrate the functionality

## Lesson 4: Building the Knowledge Base Assistant

### Implementation Process

*To be implemented*

## General Implementation Notes

### Code Organization

- Each lesson has a corresponding markdown file in the `lessons` directory
- Code implementations are in the `code` directory
- Test scripts are named with a `test_` prefix
- Each implementation file has detailed docstrings and comments

### Testing Approach

- Each major component has a dedicated test script
- Tests demonstrate functionality with practical examples
- Test scripts can be run independently to verify specific components

### Best Practices Used

- Comprehensive docstrings for all classes and methods
- Type hints and parameter descriptions
- Error handling for edge cases
- Modular design with clear separation of concerns
- Consistent naming conventions

## Next Steps

- Implement Lesson 4: Building the Knowledge Base Assistant
- Create exercise solutions for all lessons
- Add more advanced examples and use cases
- Integrate with actual vector embedding models (optional)
