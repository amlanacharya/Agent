## 📚 Overview

Welcome to Module 2 of the Accelerated Agentic AI Mastery course! This module covers memory systems for AI agents, focusing on different memory types (working, short-term, long-term), vector database fundamentals, and retrieval patterns for contextual memory.

> 💡 **Note**: Module 2 builds on the agent fundamentals from Module 1 and introduces more sophisticated memory systems. We'll continue using simulated responses where an LLM would typically be used, but we'll also explore how to set up actual vector databases for more advanced memory capabilities.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Start by reading through the lessons in order:
   - **lessons/lesson1.md**: Memory Types for AI Agents
   - **lessons/lesson2.md**: Vector Database Fundamentals
   - **lessons/lesson3.md**: Retrieval Patterns for Contextual Memory
   - **lessons/lesson4.md**: Building the Knowledge Base Assistant

2. Examine the code examples for each lesson:
   - Lesson 1: **code/memory_types.py**
   - Lesson 2: **code/vector_store.py**
   - Lesson 3: **code/retrieval_agent.py**
   - Lesson 4: **code/kb_agent.py**

3. Run the test scripts to see the memory systems in action:
   ```
   python module2/code/test_memory_types.py
   python module2/code/test_vector_store.py
   python module2/code/test_retrieval_agent.py
   python module2/code/test_kb_agent.py
   ```

4. Try the interactive demos by running:
   ```
   python module2/code/memory_types.py
   python module2/code/vector_store.py
   python module2/code/retrieval_agent.py
   python module2/code/kb_agent.py
   ```

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will:
- Understand different memory types for AI agents
- Learn vector database fundamentals
- Master retrieval patterns for contextual memory
- Build a knowledge base assistant

## 🧪 Practice Exercises

The lessons include several practice exercises to help reinforce your learning:
1. Implementing different memory types
2. Creating a simple vector database
3. Designing effective retrieval patterns

## 📝 Mini-Project: Knowledge Base Assistant

Throughout this module, you'll be building a Knowledge Base Assistant that can:
- Store and retrieve information from a knowledge base
- Answer questions based on stored knowledge
- Learn new information from conversations
- Identify when it doesn't know something
- Provide citations for its answers
