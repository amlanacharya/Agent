### Why Academic Papers Are Challenging for RAG Systems

Academic papers and research literature present unique challenges for RAG systems:

1. **Complex Structure**: Academic papers have a standardized but complex structure (abstract, introduction, methods, results, discussion, references) that requires specialized processing.

2. **Dense Technical Content**: Research papers contain dense, domain-specific terminology and concepts that require specialized knowledge to understand.

3. **Citation Networks**: Papers reference other papers, creating a complex network of citations that needs to be tracked and verified.

4. **Figures and Tables**: Important information is often contained in figures, tables, and equations that may be difficult to extract and process.

5. **Specialized Questions**: Users often ask complex, multi-part research questions that require synthesizing information across multiple papers.

Building a Research Literature Assistant requires addressing these challenges with advanced RAG techniques.

## 📄 Academic Paper Processing

### Specialized Document Processing for Research Papers

Processing academic papers effectively requires specialized techniques:

```python
from langchain.document_loaders import PyPDFLoader
from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter

class AcademicPaperProcessor:
    """Process academic papers with specialized techniques."""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.section_headers = [
            "abstract", "introduction", "background", "related work", 
            "methodology", "methods", "experiments", "results", 
            "discussion", "conclusion", "references"
        ]
    
    def extract_sections(self, text):
        """Extract sections from academic paper."""
        # TODO: Implement section extraction based on common academic paper structure
        
    def extract_citations(self, text):
        """Extract citations from academic paper."""
        # TODO: Implement citation extraction (e.g., [Author, Year])
        
    def extract_figures_and_tables(self, text):
        """Extract figures and tables from academic paper."""
        # TODO: Implement figure and table extraction
        
    def process_paper(self, file_path):
        """Process academic paper from PDF."""
        loader = PyPDFLoader(file_path)
        pages = loader.load()
        
        # Extract metadata
        metadata = self._extract_metadata(pages)
        
        # Extract full text
        full_text = "\n\n".join([page.page_content for page in pages])
        
        # Extract sections
        sections = self.extract_sections(full_text)
        
        # Extract citations
        citations = self.extract_citations(full_text)
        
        # Create specialized chunks
        splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(
            chunk_size=1000,
            chunk_overlap=200,
            separators=["\n\n", "\n", ". ", " ", ""]
        )
        
        chunks = []
        for section_name, section_text in sections.items():
            section_chunks = splitter.create_documents(
                texts=[section_text],
                metadatas=[{
                    "source": file_path,
                    "section": section_name,
                    **metadata
                }]
            )
            chunks.extend(section_chunks)
        
        return {
            "chunks": chunks,
            "metadata": metadata,
            "citations": citations
        }
    
    def _extract_metadata(self, pages):
        """Extract metadata from academic paper."""
        # TODO: Extract title, authors, publication date, journal/conference, DOI
        return {}
```

This specialized processor handles the unique structure of academic papers, extracting sections, citations, and metadata to enable more effective retrieval and question answering.

## 📊 Citation Tracking and Verification

### Building a Citation Network

Citations are a critical part of academic literature. A Research Literature Assistant needs to track and verify citations:

```python
class CitationTracker:
    """Track and verify citations across academic papers."""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.citation_graph = {}  # Paper ID -> [Cited Paper IDs]
        self.papers = {}  # Paper ID -> Paper Metadata
    
    def add_paper(self, paper_id, metadata, citations):
        """Add a paper and its citations to the tracker."""
        self.papers[paper_id] = metadata
        self.citation_graph[paper_id] = citations
    
    def get_citing_papers(self, paper_id):
        """Get papers that cite the given paper."""
        # TODO: Implement citation lookup
        
    def get_cited_papers(self, paper_id):
        """Get papers cited by the given paper."""
        # TODO: Implement reference lookup
        
    def verify_citation(self, source_id, target_id, claim):
        """Verify if a citation supports a claim."""
        # TODO: Implement citation verification
        
    def generate_citation_path(self, start_id, end_id):
        """Find citation path between papers."""
        # TODO: Implement citation path finding
```

The citation tracker builds a graph of papers and their citations, enabling the assistant to navigate the citation network and verify claims against their sources.

## 🧠 Research Question Analysis

### Understanding Complex Research Questions

Research questions are often complex and multi-faceted. Analyzing them properly is key to providing relevant answers:

```python
class ResearchQuestionAnalyzer:
    """Analyze and decompose research questions."""
    
    def __init__(self, llm):
        self.llm = llm
    
    def analyze_question(self, question):
        """Analyze a research question to identify key components."""
        # TODO: Implement research question analysis
        
    def identify_question_type(self, question):
        """Identify the type of research question."""
        # TODO: Implement question type classification
        
    def extract_research_concepts(self, question):
        """Extract key research concepts from the question."""
        # TODO: Implement concept extraction
        
    def generate_search_queries(self, question):
        """Generate multiple search queries for the research question."""
        # TODO: Implement search query generation
```

The question analyzer helps the assistant understand what the user is asking, breaking down complex research questions into manageable components and generating effective search queries.

## 📝 Literature Review Generation

### Synthesizing Information Across Papers

A key capability of a Research Literature Assistant is generating literature reviews that synthesize information across multiple papers:

```python
class LiteratureReviewGenerator:
    """Generate literature reviews from multiple papers."""
    
    def __init__(self, llm):
        self.llm = llm
    
    def generate_review(self, question, relevant_chunks, papers_metadata):
        """Generate a literature review for a research question."""
        # TODO: Implement literature review generation
        
    def summarize_paper(self, paper_chunks, metadata):
        """Summarize a single paper."""
        # TODO: Implement paper summarization
        
    def compare_methodologies(self, papers):
        """Compare methodologies across papers."""
        # TODO: Implement methodology comparison
        
    def identify_research_gaps(self, papers, question):
        """Identify research gaps related to the question."""
        # TODO: Implement research gap identification
        
    def format_with_citations(self, review_text, citations):
        """Format review text with proper citations."""
        # TODO: Implement citation formatting
```

The literature review generator synthesizes information across multiple papers, comparing methodologies, identifying research gaps, and ensuring proper citation of sources.

## 🔗 Building a Complete Research Literature Assistant

### Putting It All Together with LCEL

Now we'll combine all these components into a complete Research Literature Assistant using LangChain Expression Language (LCEL):

```python
from langchain.schema.runnable import RunnablePassthrough, RunnableLambda
from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate
from langchain.vectorstores import FAISS
from langchain.embeddings import HuggingFaceEmbeddings

class ResearchLiteratureAssistant:
    """Complete Research Literature Assistant using LCEL."""
    
    def __init__(self, llm, embedding_model=None):
        self.llm = llm
        self.embedding_model = embedding_model or HuggingFaceEmbeddings(
            model_name="sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2"
        )
        self.paper_processor = AcademicPaperProcessor()
        self.citation_tracker = CitationTracker()
        self.question_analyzer = ResearchQuestionAnalyzer(llm)
        self.review_generator = LiteratureReviewGenerator(llm)
        self.vectorstore = None
    
    def add_paper(self, file_path):
        """Process and add a paper to the assistant."""
        # TODO: Implement paper processing and indexing
        
    def build_index(self):
        """Build vector index from processed papers."""
        # TODO: Implement index building
        
    def create_chain(self):
        """Create LCEL chain for the assistant."""
        # TODO: Implement LCEL chain
        
    def answer_research_question(self, question):
        """Answer a research question using the assistant."""
        # TODO: Implement research question answering
        
    def generate_literature_review(self, topic):
        """Generate a literature review on a topic."""
        # TODO: Implement literature review generation
```

The complete Research Literature Assistant combines all the specialized components we've built, using LCEL to create a flexible, powerful system for answering research questions and generating literature reviews.
