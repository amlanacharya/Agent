## 📚 Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:
- Completed Module 4: Document Processing & RAG Foundations
- Understanding of basic RAG concepts and implementation
- Familiarity with LangChain and LCEL
- Experience with vector databases and embedding models

## 🚀 Mini-Project: Research Literature Assistant

The culminating project for this module is a Research Literature Assistant that can:
- Process and index academic papers
- Answer complex research questions
- Generate literature reviews
- Track and verify citations
- Synthesize information across multiple papers

This assistant will demonstrate the practical application of all the advanced RAG techniques covered in the module.

## 📊 Diagrams and Visualizations

This module includes comprehensive diagrams to help visualize complex RAG architectures and workflows. The diagrams are organized in two main locations:

1. **`lessons/module5_diagrams.md`** - Contains the complete diagrams for all key concepts
2. **`diagrams/module5_progressive_journey.md`** - Provides a progressive journey through each concept, breaking down complex architectures into stages

The diagrams cover:

- Advanced retrieval strategies (hybrid search, multi-index, parent document retrieval)
- Query transformation techniques (expansion, multi-query, HyDE, step-back prompting)
- Reranking systems (cross-encoder, reciprocal rank fusion, MMR)
- Self-querying and adaptive RAG (query routing, controlled RAG, multi-hop reasoning)
- Research Literature Assistant architecture
- RAG evaluation frameworks (comprehensive metrics, RAGAS)
- LCEL implementation patterns

These diagrams serve as visual references to help understand the complex architectures and data flows in advanced RAG systems. They are designed to complement the code implementations and provide a high-level overview of how different components interact.
