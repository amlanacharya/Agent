   - Create research question analysis
   - Develop literature review generation

## 💻 Technologies Used

- **LangChain**: Core framework for building RAG systems
- **LCEL**: LangChain Expression Language for chain construction
- **FAISS/ChromaDB**: Vector databases for efficient retrieval
- **Hugging Face**: Models for embeddings and reranking
- **Groq API**: LLM integration for generation tasks
- **RAGAS**: Evaluation framework for RAG systems

## 📚 Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:
- Completed Module 4: Document Processing & RAG Foundations
- Understanding of basic RAG concepts and implementation
- Familiarity with LangChain and LCEL
- Experience with vector databases and embedding models

## 🚀 Mini-Project: Research Literature Assistant

The culminating project for this module is a Research Literature Assistant that can:
