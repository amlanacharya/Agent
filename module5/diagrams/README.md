# Module 5 Diagrams

This directory contains diagrams illustrating various aspects of Module 5: Advanced RAG Systems.

## Available Diagrams

### Complete Diagrams

1. **[Module 5 Diagrams](../lessons/module5_diagrams.md)** - Original diagrams from the module lessons showing advanced retrieval strategies, query transformation techniques, reranking systems, adaptive RAG, and research literature assistant architecture.

### Progressive Journey Diagrams

2. **Module 5 Progressive Journey** - A stage-by-stage breakdown of the advanced RAG systems in Module 5, gradually building up to the complete picture:

   - **Advanced Retrieval**: Progressive stages from basic vector search to hybrid search, multi-index retrieval, and contextual compression
   - **Query Transformation**: Progressive stages showing the evolution from simple queries to advanced transformation techniques
   - **Reranking Systems**: Progressive stages revealing how reranking improves retrieval quality
   - **Adaptive RAG**: Progressive stages demonstrating how RAG systems can adapt to different query types
   - **Research Literature Assistant**: Progressive stages building up to a complete research assistant

## How to View These Diagrams

These diagrams use Mermaid syntax, which can be rendered in:

1. GitHub Markdown files (automatically rendered)
2. VS Code with the Mermaid extension
3. Online Mermaid editors like [Mermaid Live Editor](https://mermaid.live/)
4. Documentation tools like MkDocs with the Mermaid plugin

## Diagram Types

The diagrams in this directory include:

- **Flowcharts** - Depicting advanced RAG architectures and data flows
- **Class Diagrams** - Showing the structure and relationships between system components
- **Sequence Diagrams** - Illustrating the flow of operations in advanced RAG systems
- **Architecture Diagrams** - Representing the overall system design

## Progressive Approach

Many of the diagrams in this collection follow a progressive approach:

1. **Stage 1: Basic Components** - Introducing the fundamental building blocks
2. **Stage 2: Component Integration** - Showing how basic components connect
3. **Stage 3: Advanced Features** - Adding sophisticated capabilities
4. **Stage 4: Complete System** - Presenting the fully integrated system

This approach helps learners understand complex systems by breaking them down into manageable pieces and gradually building up to the complete picture.

## Diagram Styling

All diagrams follow a consistent styling approach:

- **Input/Output Nodes**: Pink fill (#f9f) for inputs, blue fill (#bbf) for outputs
- **Processing Nodes**: Green fill (#dfd) for LLM/AI components, red fill (#fdd) for transformations
- **Connection Lines**: Solid lines for direct data flow, dashed lines for optional flows
- **Emphasis**: Thicker borders (2px) for key components, thinner (1px) for supporting elements

This consistent styling helps create a visual language that makes diagrams easier to understand at a glance.
